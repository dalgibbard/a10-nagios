A10 Loadbalancer Nagios Check Utilities Written in Python

h2. Overview
This is an initial rough template whilst working out some wrinkles in

The end goal is to have a few checks which monitor Active Pool member counts, as
well as the possibility of managing A10 configurations via Puppet or similar
later down the line.
